## Prerequisites

The following tools need to be installed on your machine:

- [CMSIS-Toolbox v2.12.0](https://github.com/Open-CMSIS-Pack/cmsis-toolbox/releases) or newer.
- [Arm Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded)
  (automatically installed via vcpkg when using Visual Studio Code).
- [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with Keil Studio Pack extension.

## Build the example

### Using Visual Studio Code with extensions

Required tools described in file `vcpkg-configuration.json` should be automatically installed by vcpkg. You can see the
status of vcpkg in the status bar.

Required CMSIS packs need to be also installed. In case a required pack is missing, a notification window will pop-up
to install the missing pack.

Open the 'CMSIS' view from the side bar, select desired 'Build Type' and press the 'Build' button.

### Using Command Line Interface (CLI)

Download required packs (not required when the packs are already available) by executing the following commands:

```sh
csolution list packs -s hello.csolution.yml -m > packs.txt
cpackget update-index
cpackget add -f packs.txt
```

Build the project by executing the following command:

```sh
cbuild hello.csolution.yml
```

## Run the example

### Run in Visual Studio Code

- Connect the board's ST-LINK USB to the PC (provides also power).
- Open the 'CMSIS' view from the side bar:
    - Press the 'Run' button and wait until the image is programmed and starts running.

### Using Drag-and-drop programming or external programmer and terminal

- Connect the board's ST-LINK USB to the PC (provides also power).
- Program the image (.hex) using drag-and-drop programming or use an external programmer.
- Open a terminal on the PC and connect to the board's serial port with 115200 baud rate.
- Observe the terminal output.

## Debug the example

Before starting to debug the application, make sure that you have gone through the steps as described in the
[run the application](#run-the-application) section.

### Debug in Visual Studio Code

Open the **CMSIS** view from the side bar and press the **Debug** button. In the **Debug** view, use the
**SERIAL MONITOR** to connect to the board's serial port with 115200 baud rate and observe the output.
